# Magic-Sentences
A continuation of the Sentence-Generator which checks how many random generated sentences are actually magical

# Before Running
Create propozitii.txt through the Sentence-Generator repository.
Add magic sentences on each row in propozitiiMagice.txt 

Displays every magic sentence that appeares in the propozitii.txt

Displays for every sentence in propozitii.txt how much of a magic sentence it is (procentually)
If the procetage is 0 it won't display it.

# Example
Let's assume "Kids are young" is a magic sentence.
If we have a generated sentence "Kids wear shorts" then it means it is 33% magical, because only one word (out of 3) is included in a magical sentence.
